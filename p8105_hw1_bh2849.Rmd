## Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Let's load the 'penguins' dataset 

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Write a short description of the 'penguins' dataset

#### the data in this dataset 
```{r}
# It includes names / values of important variables
summary(penguins)
```

#### the size of the dataset 

```{r}
#the number of rows in 'penguins'
nrow(penguins)
#the number of columns in 'penguins'
ncol(penguins)
```

#### the mean flipper length
```{r}

mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm)

```


#### Make a scatterplot
```{r}
penguins %>%
ggplot(aes(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
    geom_point()

```

## Problem 2

```{r}
example_df = 
  tibble(
    var_numeric = rnorm(10),
    var_logical = ,
    var_char = c("A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J"),
    var_factor = factor(c("Red","Red","Blue", "Red","Blue","Red","Blue", "Black","Black","Black"))
  )
```
